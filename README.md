# Cops and Robbers
Cops and Robbers is a 2 dimensional grid-based game where the objective is to gather treasures and escape a level without being caught by guards. This game was created as a semester project for my Object Oriented Design class. I worked with 3 other group members to create this game.


# Technical Requirements: 
- The game cannot be similiar to an existing game
- The game should be single-player
- The game must use a GUI, which must be created with Swing
- The design must be object-oriented
- The game must use a grid-based board
- The character(s) need to be able to move around the board; this movement should occur by clicking the location where the character should move
- The game must be able to be won or lost
